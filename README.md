Thompson, AC. "Land of the Free: A woman's place in critical geography" master's thesis in Risk & Resilience, Harvard University Graduate School of Design, 2017.

DESCRIPTION: This research aims to reframe and project our collective understanding of the scale and power of women, achieved through representation of and speculative analysis on the historic mobilizations that occured on the 21st of January 2017, the Women's March on Washington and sister marches worldwide. Aligned with the ambition of the work, this shapefile has been publicly posted for widest dissemination for analysis, iteration, improvement, and expansion in order to generate new knowledge that may be operationalized through critical geographies both real and imaginary. 

CONTRIBUTION: This shapefile serves as the foundation for a comprehensive spatial analysis of the women's march that speculates far beyond attendance count by city. By associating spatial and demographic information keyed by GNIS_ID to the city and by GEOID to the county, an infinite cross-cutting of census and voter data may be examined and correlated to the locations where mobilization occurred across the national territory. To note, the methodology above also served as a comprehensive validation of the data format and content, thus the USA (including territories) city count was reduced from the original collection [675] to [641] herein.
